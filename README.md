## ZenWake

application to help users wake up and help them start the day with the weather, news, etc.

# About ZenWake

In this recent project, I delved into key concepts of mobile development while creating a smart alarm app in Flutter. The goal wasn't just to make the app work, but also to understand and apply real-world tools used in modern apps.

# Technologies

This app is an excellent opportunity to practice integrating external services, handling JSON responses, and dynamically updating information within the app.
It includes features such as:
• State management with Provider, ChangeNotifier, Listeners, and setState.
• Integration with device sensors for wake-up challenges.
• Use of the OpenWeatherAPI as practice for integrating external APIs.
• Logging and analyzing data such as sleep time and performance.
